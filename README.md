# Koomz Minting Page

[Preview of the Kooomz Minting Page ](https://logoxo.github.io/koomz_minting_page/)

Koomz clothing once commissioned me to develop a minting site for their NFT, unfortunately they never launched their NFT. That you also have no use for the page, I'll post it on my Github, maybe someone will have a use for it for the next nft project.
