# Koomz Minting Page

[Preview of the Koomz Minting Page ](https://logoxo.github.io/koomz_minting_page/)

Koomz Clothing once asked me to develop a Minting page for their NFT, unfortunately they never launched their NFT. Since they also have no use for the page anymore, I decided to post the page on Github, maybe someone else has a use for the page.
