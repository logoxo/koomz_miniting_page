    The KOOMZ brand is tied to an NFT. That means after every purchase 
of KOOMZ clothing from the new collection, a part of the money goes 
to the NFT to increase value. KOOMZ every successful purchase of an 
KOOMZ logo T-shirt, the buyer gets an KOOMZ NFT. Please keep in 
mind you get only one NFT on purchase of a logo T-shirt, and as the 
NFT increases, so does the price of the logo T-shirt. In case of all other 
clothing, there is, however, no increase in value. More the orders
come in, higher goes the value of the NFT. The maximum value of
 KOOMZ NFT is 5,000.
